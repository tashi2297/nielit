The Temi Tea Garden in Temi, established in 1969 by the Government of Sikkim, is located in South Sikkim in the northeastern Indian state of Sikkim. It is the only tea garden in Sikkim and is considered one of the best in India and the world.

Top quality tea is produced, which is in demand in the international market. The garden is laid over a gradually sloping hill. The tea produced in this garden is also partly marketed under the trade name "Temi Tea".

The guidelines issued by the Institute of Marketology (IMO) of Switzerland to produce organic tea have been adopted in the Temi Tea Garden; a project initiated in April 2005 and nearing completion. 

In growing organic tea, agrochemicals are avoided by the tea estates that resulting in low production costs. Many European countries and Japan have shown a preference for tea produced by adopting the organic manuring method.</p>
