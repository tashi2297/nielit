When we hear about Char Dham, we usually remember the four holy shrines on top of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand- Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath. Also, four pilgrimage sites, Uttarakhand’s Badrinath, Odisha’s Puri, Tamil Nadu’s Rameshwaram and Gujarat’s Dwarka are collectively called Char Dham. And the replica of these four shrines, along with 12 jyotirlingas, have been built atop the Solophok Hill in South Sikkim’s Namchi. Also known as the Siddhesvara Dham, the sweeping temple compound was inaugurated in November 2011. The picturesque complex also houses a 108-feet statue of Lord Shiva.

Around 2 hours drive away from Sikkim’s capital, Gangtok, lies the marvellous temple compound of Char Dham locked away by spectacular mountains. The place is believed to wash off anybody’s sins. It comprises four shrines dedicated to Lord Vishnu, Lord Krishna, Lord Jagannath and Lord Shiva. The shrine compound falls on the hilly route between Melli and Jorethang.

The gorgeous expanse of Char Dham, Namchi embraces profound serenity. By visiting this place, anybody will be able to attain a heightened solace.
The replicas of the twelve jyotirlingas or Dwadash Jyotirlingas namely, Somnath, Mallikarjuna, Mahakaleswar, Omkareshwar, Kedarnath, Bhimashankar, Viswanath, Triambakeshwar, Vaidyanath, Nageswar, Rameshwar and Grishneshwar encompass the statue of Lord Shiva and the Char Dhams.

A jyotirlinga is a holy object which represents Lord Shiva. Jyoti translates to radiance and lingam means symbol of Shiva. According to beliefs, worshipping Shiva and the jyotirlingas assists people in gaining enlightenment.</p>
