# **About The Project**


<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Sikkim is one of the most beautiful State located in the north-eastern part of India. Protected by the
might of the majestic Kanchenzonga and blessed by the chanting of the holy gods, Sikkim magnificently
rests on the lap of the nature amidst mystical tranquillity.
The State Government and the Department of Tourism &amp; Civil Aviation since time has been
instrumental in promoting the state as a prominent tourist avenue with the prime motive of allowing the
enthusiastic explorer to witness the marvellous natural beauty and simulatenously uplifting the
economic prosperity of the stakeholders, a win-win situation for all.
The state has witnessed a tremendous surge in the influx of domestic and foreign tourists in the last
decade. With 5.5L domestic visitors in 2011 to around 14.2L visitors in 2019 and .23L foreign visitors in
2011 to 1.33L visitor in 2019, Sikkim has an incredible prospect and potential to be a pioneer in the
tourism business. Even during the pandemic struck business years of 2020 and 2021, Sikkim could
cater to almost 4.8L tourists abiding by the strict protocols.
This boom in the tourism industry has in fact motivated many entrepreneurs to actively venture into
hospitality avenues and Sikkim has around 1117 hotels, 1313 Homestays, 1522 Travel Agents and 667
restaurants, which indeed is a remarkable feat of achievement. Sikkim’s hospitality business aptly fits
varying customer’s needs ranging from the most exclusive to moderate and economical. These
avenues are coordinated and regulated by various government recognized agencies like the Travel
Agents Association of Sikkim (TAAS), Sikkim Association of Adventure Tour Operators (SAATO),
Sikkim Hotel &amp; Restaurant Association (SHRA), Sikkim United Tourism Organisation (SUTO), All
Sikkim Travel &amp; Hospitality Association (ASTHA), All Sikkim Luxury Vehicle Association (ASLVA),
Sikkim Mountaineering Association (SMA), Sikkim Paragliding Association (SPA), and Own Run Hotel
Association of Sikkim (ORHAS).

Travel and Tourism Ecosystem of Sikkim mainly comprises of the following stakeholders: 
</p>

- [x] Accomodation Providers:- Hotels, Lodges, Bed &amp; Breakfast establishments, Homestays,
Guest House, Resorts &amp; Spas, Service Apartments

- [x] Eateries:- Restaurants, Fast Foods

- [x] Tours &amp; Travels:- Local Tour &amp; Travel Agencies, Logistic Service Providers, Booking
Facilitation Centres

- [x] Entertainment &amp; Recreation:- Adventure tour operators, entertainment agencies, event
facilitators, MICE [Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions ] co-ordinators

- [x] Tour Guides &amp; Photographers:- Tour guides, outdoor photographers

- [x] Tourism Stakeholder Associations : - Travel Agents Association of Sikkim (TAAS), Sikkim
Association of Adventure Tour Operators (SAATO), Sikkim Hotel &amp; Restaurant Association
(SHRA), Sikkim United Tourism Organisation (SUTO), All Sikkim Travel &amp; Hospitality
Association (ASTHA), All Sikkim Luxury Vehicle Association (ASLVA),etc

- [x] Indirect Stakeholders:- Self Help Groups (SHG), homemakers dealing with
Tourism/indigenous products of Sikkim, products from the cottage industry of Sikkim - pickles,
tea, juices, bamboo shoot, “dalley khorsani” – the famous red hot chilli of Sikkim, etc.
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
However, as majority of the stakeholders and local population do not have the required ICT skills which
is very much required in today’s world especially in Travel and Tourism sector which is witnessing a
technology shift, ICT intervention is very much needed so that they can enhance their reach through
digital skills and earn better livelihood through T&amp;T industry. 

In brief, the challenges are:</p>

- [x] Travelers use Internet and Digital platforms these days. However, locals and the stakeholders lack
these Digital Skills

- [x] Enabling environment and capacities in newer technologies such as Augmented and Virtual Reality
(AR/VR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), etc are absent

- [x]   Economic benefits from Travel and Tourism Industry are unevenly distributed and not broad based
to support local, social and economic development.
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
There is therefore, a necessity to build capacity of the stake holders comprising Hotels, Tour Operator,
Adventure Tour Operator, Logistic and Travel Services providing tour guides and also the staff
operating and managing Tourist Information Centre, Rural Tourism Facilitation Centres at strategic
location and in Permit Offices.
Empowering the stakeholders and the generic candidates with Digital Skills will help them leverage the
benefits of ICT thereby opening livelihood avenues as appropriate ICT intervention can provide much
needed impetus especially as COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the industry.
This project therefore proposes organizing the Training/Capacity Building for stakeholders to enable
them to promote their business, grow and sustain by providing exemplary services to tourist and
travellers and also train generic candidates not currently involved in Travel and Tourism to create local
entrepreneurs in the field of Travel &amp; Tourism who can evolve and execute digital/online/web marketing
strategies to reach potential customer using basic and emerging technologies thus opening up new and
innovative product development opportunities.
Use of modern technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented and Virtual Reality
(AR/VR), Social Networking, etc in Travel and Tourism (T&amp;T) industry which are witnessing massive
transformation as a result of advances in Information &amp; Communication Technologies (ICT) and the
processes of Digitalisation such as:
</p>

- [x] Digital Marketing through social media pages, blogs, etc.

- [x] presence in online global travel forums such as Trip Advisor, etc and e-commerce sites.

- [x] integration of Conversational Artificial Intelligence in the form of Chat Bots to the social
media pages, websites

- [x] use of collaborative social media platforms and Web 2.0 which has facilitated user-generated
content, thus opening up new and innovative product development opportunities.and

- [x] making use of immersive technologies such as AR and VR to create 360 degree immersive
and interactive virtual environment of the tourist spots and tourism property

- [x] AI powered multilingual e-audio contents for e-Tourist guides, etc can further empower the stakeholders by helping them enhance their reach and earn better livelihood through T&amp;T industry.
<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
As such, every place in the State has the potential of becoming a tourist spot if marketed effectively using digital platforms and modern day technologies.
In addition to capacity building, initiatives such as providing immersive experiences through Virtual
Reality, mobile application for multilingual e-audio contents acting as e-tourist guides, etc will
provide improved tourist experience and can also act as new sources of livelihood for the local
population. Therefore, it is proposed to develop VR contents as well as multilingual e-audio contents for
various tourist locations of Gangtok with information and logistic support by Sikkim Tourism
Development Corporation Ltd (STDC).
Further, the training infrastructure can also act as an enabling environment for new age technologies
that will help the newer generation/youths and stakeholders to leverage technology for Travel and
Tourism industry and capture success stories through AR/VR in Travel and Tourism (T&amp;T) Industry as
the infrastructure can be readily used by the newer generation/youths/stakeholders to capture/create
content for AR/VR and create real life Tourism /Travel based AR/VR applications and resources if
suitable handholding/training is provided. The infrastrcture with specialist manpower will therefore
provide platform for involving youths and newer generation with modern technological concepts for
creation of entrepreneurs and development of digitally transformed Travel and Tourism based startups
and Small and Medium Enterprises (SME).
